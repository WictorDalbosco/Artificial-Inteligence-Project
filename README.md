# Artificial Inteligence Project for discipline SCC0630
Project for IA Subject where we study Geographics Networks and Search Algorithms  

Inside the Jupyer Notebook you can find some experiments using a Geographic Network (Rede Geogr√°fica) to perform some searchs using algorithms such as BFS, DFS, Best-First, Dijkstra and A* (A star).

At the report, you will find some explanations in portuguese about the search algorithms and the results of the experiments.
